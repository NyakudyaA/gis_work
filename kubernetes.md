Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/tmp/kubeadm-init-dryrun661931801/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 192.168.0.5:6443 --token zh52la.p8oiamij98stix9i \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:804f994782dfcac591348b7b1fe684bda34b649579270be91eb3cb7f4fe9819d
